# Real-time Data Display Instructions

## Objective
Implement the ability to display current blood oxygen level (SpO2 as a percentage) and current heart rate in real-time while the device is connected.

## Context
The application needs to display the current blood oxygen level (SpO2 as a percentage) and current heart rate in real-time while the device is connected. This involves updating the UI with the latest data received from the pulse oximeter.

## Dependencies
- None

## Steps
1. Implement the UI elements to display the current blood oxygen level (SpO2 as a percentage) and current heart rate.
2. Implement the functionality to update the UI with the latest data received from the pulse oximeter.
3. Ensure the UI updates in real-time while the device is connected.

## Expected Output
- Display current blood oxygen level (SpO2 as a percentage).
- Display current heart rate.
- Update in real-time while device is connected.

## Notes
- Consider the user experience when designing the UI elements.
- Ensure the UI updates are smooth and efficient.
