# Data Visualization Instructions

## Objective
Implement the ability to visualize the recorded data for analysis.

## Context
The application needs to visualize the recorded data for analysis. This involves displaying the data in tabular format and line graphs.

## Dependencies
- None

## Steps
1. Implement a tabular display with datetime, SpO2 (%), and heart rate columns.
2. Implement two line graphs (one for SpO2, one for heart rate) with time on the x-axis.

## Expected Output
- Tabular display with datetime, SpO2 (%), and heart rate columns.
- Two line graphs (one for SpO2, one for heart rate) with time on the x-axis.

## Notes
- Consider using a charting library for the line graphs.
- Ensure the data is displayed clearly and accurately.
