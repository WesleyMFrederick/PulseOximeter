# Changelog

- 2025-03-16 16:05: Developed comprehensive data storage strategy.
    - Description: Created detailed architecture for pulse oximeter data storage using Core Data, designing a model with Recording, ParamReading, and WaveReading entities. Developed technical specifications for PersistenceController, RecordingManager, and UI components to manage recordings.
    - Reason: To enable persistent storage of pulse oximeter readings with efficient handling of both clinical parameter data and high-frequency waveform data.
    - Affected files: strategy_tasks/data_storage_instructions.txt, cline_docs/activeContext.md

- 2025-03-16 15:33: Implemented data parsing for Bluetooth pulse oximeter data.
    - Description: Removed the placeholder data and timer from `BluetoothManager.swift`.
    - Reason: To ensure the UI displays the parsed values from the Bluetooth device.
    - Affected files: src/BluetoothManager.swift, cline_docs/activeContext.md
